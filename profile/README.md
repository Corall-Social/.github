**Corall** is a modern communication initiative focused on building **secure, private, and human-centered messaging solutions**.
We design tools that make digital conversations seamless, safe, and accessible — for individuals, teams, and communities.

## 🌊 Our Vision

We believe communication technology should be:

* 🔒 **Private** — conversations stay between the people involved.
* 🌍 **Inclusive** — built for everyone, across platforms and devices.
* ⚡ **Reliable** — fast, stable, and designed for real-world use.
* 🤝 **Open** — transparent and community-driven.

## ✨ What We Build

* **Corall App** – our flagship social networking service, combining speed, security, and simplicity.
* **Corall Infrastructure** – scalable backend services powering reliable communication.
* **Corall Design System** – a unified set of UI/UX components for consistent, accessible experiences.

## 💡 Why Corall?

Most messengers today force a trade-off between **usability, privacy, and trust**.
Corall is designed to remove that compromise:

* 🛡 End-to-end encryption by default
* 🎨 Lightweight, modern UX
* 🌐 Transparent development & open-source values
* 📡 Built to scale from private chats to large communities

**Corall isn’t just another messaging app — it’s a communication ecosystem that respects users first.**
